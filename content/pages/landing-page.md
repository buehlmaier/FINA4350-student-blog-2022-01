This blog is written by HKU students. It serves two purposes: First,
to document students' reflections about their learning
progress. Second, to showcase some of the results students have
obtained as part of their projects.

The topics of the blog posts are about text analytics and natural
language processing (NLP) in finance and fintech. At any rate, keep in
mind that this blog is "work in progress." The blog will be updated
throughout the course as new blog posts become available.
